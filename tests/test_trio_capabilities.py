"""Trio capabilities, and the two ways this could quietly lie.

The advisor reasons spell by spell and has no notion of a capability, so it
cannot know a PAL/ENC/MNK has no snare and no SoW — which rules out kiting —
or that slow lands at level 9. The vendored eqltools picker snapshot answers
both, but only if two rules hold:

1. Membership in byClass IS the capability; `level` is optional. `track`
   records no level for any of BRD/DRU/RNG, and the original design filtered
   on "level is None" — which would have told a Ranger they cannot track.
2. No snapshot is UNKNOWN, never "lacks everything". Same rule as the gear
   gates: a comparison that never ran is not a verdict.
