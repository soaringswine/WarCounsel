"""Item facts LEARNED from the game's own exports, not the wiki.

eqlwiki does not document every item -- launch added a whole block of them
(ids around 69xxx) and several are gear a player is already WEARING. Without
a wiki page there is no Slot line, and every recommend path needs one to
place an item, so a perfectly good piece sat in a bag with the matching slot
empty and nothing said so.

The export already answers the part that matters. For a worn row the
Location column IS the slot, and the game only let the item go there if the
character could use it. So:

    slot          <- learned, free, exact
    trio-usable   <- implied (the game accepted it)
    stats         <- still wiki-only, and still refused when missing

Keyed on the item ID, not the name: an id is stable across +N merges (a base
item and its +2 share one), so "Boots of the Long Road" and its +2 teach the
same fact once. Names also get decorated and collide; ids do not.

Deliberately NOT inferred: stats, and the slot of an item never yet worn. A
guess about where a piece goes would be the same class of error as a fuzzy
zone match -- it reads as knowledge and is wrong invisibly.
