"""What is worth picking up in the zone you are standing in.

Reverses the lookup the Quests tab already does. That one asks "which quests
want this item I hold"; this asks "which of the things I want drop HERE", so
a zone line becomes a short list of things not to vendor.

Two hard limits, both measured rather than assumed (2026-08-14):

- **Class-unlock items cannot be placed this way.** 0 of 20 sampled Plane of
  Sky criteria have a "Drops From" section on their wiki page at all — those
  items come off named island bosses and the wiki records that elsewhere, if
  at all. The eqlposky/EQProgression tables do carry it ("Island 5: The
  Spiroc Lord") but state no licence, so nothing is vendored from them. Sky
  is therefore absent here on purpose, not by oversight.
- **We can only want what we can already see.** Quest rows come from items
  you HOLD, so a quest needing something you have none of is invisible. Race
  unlocks are the exception: that table is curated, so all seven turn-ins
  count whether you hold any or not.

36 of 41 candidates resolved to a zone on a real character, which is the
coverage to expect.
