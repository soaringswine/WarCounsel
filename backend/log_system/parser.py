"""EQL log line parser.

EQ log lines look like:
    [Sat Jul 05 11:30:00 2026] You have entered Rivervale.

All patterns live in this file so format drift after a game patch means
editing ONE table. Order in `parse_line` matters: pet lines are
chat-shaped and precede the CHAT GUARD; the guard precedes all combat
matching (players quoting combat text would pollute the parse); specific
formats (spell-damage "by <spell>") come before generic melee. Trailing
combat tags STACK ("... damage. (Riposte) (Critical)") and are stripped
before matching — the crit flag rides on the damage event.
