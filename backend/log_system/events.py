"""Event schemas for parsed EQL log lines.

Every parser match becomes one of these models. To add a new event type:
1. Add a subclass here with `type` set to a new string.
2. Add a regex + branch in parser.py that returns it.
3. (Optional) Handle it in state_tracker.py and/or persist it in main.py.
The WebSocket payload is `event.model_dump(mode="json")` — the frontend
switches on the `type` field.
