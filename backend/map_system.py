"""Zone maps + travel routing.

Renders data from the game's own vector map files
(`<EQL>\\maps\\*.txt`, classic EQ format):
    L x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, r, g, b      — line segment
    P x, y, z, r, g, b, size, Label_text   — labeled point

Map-space convention: file coords are already (-locX, -locY), i.e. a /loc
position plots at (-x, -y) with screen-y pointing down.

To support a zone the game names differently, add it to ZONE_FILES (map
lookup) and ZONE_GRAPH (routing). Unknown zones degrade to "no chart".
