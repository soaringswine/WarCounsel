"""Single-process launcher for the packaged WarCounsel.

Starts the FastAPI server (which serves BOTH the API and the static UI) and
opens the dashboard in a native window. Also runnable straight from source
for a production-mode single-window experience.

This file is the executable's ONLY entrypoint, so it doubles as the
dispatcher for the helper windows. A frozen build has no interpreter to
re-invoke, and handing the bootloader `-m backend.overlay` would just start
a second server, so the overlay and the OCR calibrator are reached through
flags instead (see backend/paths.child_command).

Packaged builds are windowed — there is no console to print to — so
everything goes to a log file in the writable state dir, and a failure to
start raises a message box rather than vanishing silently.
